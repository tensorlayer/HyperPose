# Quick Start of Prediction Library

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you have HyperPose installed. (if not, you can refer to [here](../install/prediction.md)).
* Make sure you have `svn`(subversion) and `python3-pip` installed. (will be used in command line scripts)

For Linux users, you may:

```bash
sudo apt -y install subversion python3 python3-pip
```

## Install Test Data

```bash
# cd to the git repo.

sh scripts/download-test-data.sh
```

> You download them manually to `${HyperPose}/data/media/` via [LINK](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master/examples/media) **if the network is not working**.

## Install Test Models

```bash
# cd to the git repo. And download pre-trained models you want. 

sh scripts/download-openpose-thin-model.sh      # ~20  MB
sh scripts/download-tinyvgg-model.sh            # ~30  MB (UFF model)
sh scripts/download-openpose-res50-model.sh     # ~45  MB
sh scripts/download-openpose-coco-model.sh      # ~200 MB
sh scripts/download-openpose-mobile-model.sh
sh scripts/download-tinyvgg-v2-model.sh
sh scripts/download-openpose-mobile-model.sh
sh scripts/download-openpifpaf-model.sh         # ~98  MB (OpenPifPaf)
sh scripts/download-ppn-res50-model.sh          # ~50  MB (PoseProposal)
```

> You can download them manually to `${HyperPose}/data/models/` via [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w9EjMkrjxOmMw3Rf6fXXkiv_ge7M99jR?usp=sharing) **if the network is not working**.

## Predict a sequence of images

### Using a fast model

```bash
# cd to your build directory.

# Predict all images in `../data/media`
./hyperpose-cli --source ../data/media --model ../data/models/lopps-resnet50-V2-HW=368x432.onnx --w 368 --h 432
# The source flag can be ignored as the default value is `../data/media`.
```

The output images will be in the build folder.

> If you are using the `TinyVGG-V1-HW=256x384.uff` (`.uff` models are going to be deprecated by TensorRT), you may meet logging message like `ERROR: Tensor image cannot be both input and output`. This is harmless and please just ignore it. 

### Table of flags for `hyperpose-cli`

Note that the entry point of our official docker image is also `hyperpose-cli` in the `/hyperpose/build` folder.

> Also see: `./hyperpose-cli --help`

| Flag           | Meaning                                                      | Default                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| model          | Path to your model.                                          | ../data/models/TinyVGG-V2-HW=342x368.onnx |
| source         | Path to your source. <br />The source can be a folder path, a video path, an image path or the key word `camera` to open your camera. | ../data/media/video.avi                   |
| post           | Post-processing methods. This key can be `paf` or `ppn`.     | paf                                       |
| keep_ratio     | The DNN takes a fixed input size, where the images must resize to fit that input resolution. However, not hurt the original human scale, we may want to resize by padding. And this is flag enable you to do inference without break original human ratio. (Good for accuracy) | true                                      |
| w              | The input width of your model. Currently, the trained models we provide all have specific requirements for input resolution. | 432 (for your the tiny-vgg model)         |
| h              | The input height of your model.                              | 368 (for your the tiny-vgg model)         |
| max_batch_size | Maximum batch size for inference engine to execute.          | 8                                         |
| runtime        | Which runtime type to use. This can be `operator` or `stream`. If you want to open your camera or producing `imshow` window, please use `operator`. For better processing throughput on videos, please use `stream`. | operator                                  |
| imshow         | true                                                         | Whether to open an `imshow` window.       |
| saving_prefix  | The output media resource will be named after '$(saving_prefix)_$(ID).$(format) | "output"                                  |
| alpha          | The weight of key point visualization. (from 0 to 1)         | 0.5   
| logging        | Print the internal logging information or not.               | false                                    |

### Using OpenPose-based (PAF) models

```bash
./hyperpose-cli --model ../data/models/openpose-thin-V2-HW=368x432.onnx --w 432 --h 368 

./hyperpose-cli --model ../data/models/openpose-coco-V2-HW=368x656.onnx --w 656 --h 368  
```

### Use PifPaf model

```bash
./hyperpose-cli --model ../data/models/openpifpaf-resnet50-HW=368x432.onnx --w 368 --h 432 --post pifpaf
```

### Convert models into TensorRT Engine Protobuf format

You may find that it takes one or two minutes before the real prediction starts. This is because TensorRT will try to profile the model to get a optimized runtime model. 

To save the model conversion time, you can pre-compile it in advance.

```bash
./example.gen_serialized_engine --model_file ../data/models/openpose-coco-V2-HW=368x656.onnx --input_width 656 --input_height 368 --max_batch_size 20
# You'll get ../data/models/openpose-coco-V2-HW=368x656.onnx.trt
# If you only want to do inference on single images(batch size = 1), please use `--max_batch_size 1` and this will improve the engine's performance.

# Use the converted model to do prediction
./hyperpose-cli --model ../data/models/openpose-coco-V2-HW=368x656.onnx.trt --w 656 --h 368
```

> Currently, we run the models in TensorRT float32 mode. Other data type is not supported(welcome to contribute!).

## Predict a video using Operator API

```bash
./hyperpose-cli --runtime=operator --source=../data/media/video.avi
```

The output video will be in the building folder.

## Predict a video using Stream API (faster)

```bash
./hyperpose-cli --runtime=stream --source=../data/media/video.avi
# In stream API, the imshow functionality will be closed.
```

## Play with camera

```bash
./hyperpose-cli --source=camera
# Note that camera mode is not compatible with Stream API. If you want to do inference on your camera in real time, the Operator API is designed for it.
```
